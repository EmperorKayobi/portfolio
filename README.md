# Makerspace Terminal
![](https://github.com/EmperorKayobi/portfolio/blob/main/images/borne.jpg) 
## Description:
Using an arduino, we send the card identification number to a webserver, which searches for the user in a mysql database.
The status of the user is changed to online and his uptime is counted. The goal was to remplace the paper system, which was not fast enough.

### Hardware: 
- Arduino
- Raspberry pi
- RFID module
- Wood
- TFT screen & breakout
### Code:

# Alpha Shield
![](https://github.com/EmperorKayobi/portfolio/blob/main/images/AlphaShield.PNG)
## Description:
Alpha Shield is a IOT gagdet planned to be available on kickstarter in april 2021 due to legal reasons.
The circuitry on this device is more complex due to high voltage utilization.
Solidworks is used to make the shell.

# Reflow Oven
Parts ordered. - On Hold

## Description:
1ere.lu is a website destined to help high school students excel in school through courses, videos and exams.
Currently being developed, site prototype available [here](https://kayobi.engineer/)
# AI Projects
## Description:
Since I got introduced to AI, I trained multiple ML models.
My goals in the short-mid term are the following:
- Live Car Path Prediction 
- Live Fire and Victim Recognition for Drones
- Reflow Oven Profile Optimisation
## Hardware
- [AWS Deeplens](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/deeplens/)
### Soon:
- [Jetson Nano 2GB](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-2gb-developer-kit)

# Future
## Gato
![](http://geg9.lu/gato-patch.png)
### 
After all the projects above, I have planned to build a live image retransmission system for the GATO (Groupe d'Appui Technologique Operationnel).
It should send images over from drones to the operation computer and the cloud. 
On the other side, an independant computer able to procces and display the images onsite using ML should be developed

###
Cfd Simulations are also heavely studied by myself.
After a failed attempt to participate to jonk fuercher in 2019, a new research project will be presented in 2022. 
It will involve, if authorized, the use of HPC computing and a prototype.
